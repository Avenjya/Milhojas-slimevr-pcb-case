Milhojas pcb case
This is a case designed for use with the cheesecake pcb by https://github.com/Sorakage033 and uses a 804040 battery.
It is designed to fit on a standard vive ultimate tracker bracket.

There is likely something wrong with the design as i haven't had time to test it yet, will do so when i am able to.
